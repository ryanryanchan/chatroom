# chatroom

First application to dive into android programming with a backend handled by firebase. 
Inspired by pictochat on the nintendo DS, it is a chat application that can send both text messages and drawings. 
pictures are encoded into 64 bit to be sent to the firebase backend,
when recognized as a picture file, it will be decoded and displayed as a picture on the frontend. 

notifications are enabled. 

possible ways to improve our current application:

- add color
- update icons
- implement a stack for draw strokes
- implement a friend system
  - friends can talk to each other on their own channels
  - force user authentication and better overall security







-as always the code can be cleaned up
